# Domain Role Access
Provides alternative per-domain access control based on roles.

In addition to ordinary access control from the **domain_access** module
(through the field in user's profile), this module adds an ability to assign
roles to domain records.

Users, which have these roles will have the same access to this domain,
as if they had these domains filled in their profiles.
